## Project assignment (MTTPP) 2019/2020


This assignment was made with IntelliJ IDEA and Katalon Recorder, and Maven was used for reporting

If you want to make your own reports, you have to download Maven "apache-maven-x.x.x-bin.zip" from [this link](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
Then you need to extract it to any location so you can add it to your environment PATH variable like in these pictures.

### `Testing`

So in this project, the testing was done on my personal website that can be found [HERE](https://jpapez-myplan.web.app/).

In order to run already created test, you can just select one of the tests in drop down menu and click on green play button.

Or you can just right click on any java class in src/test/java path and click on "Run SomethingTest"
